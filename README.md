# CalculatingPieValue
This is a python program to calculate the value of pie upto required number of decimals using ramanujan pie-function

# Edit
I have just found that it started to give poor accuracy after 15 places of decimal, but my code seems to by correct. If you have any suggestion or correction in the code than please pull request :)
